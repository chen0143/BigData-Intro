Project for Introduction of Big Data
=======


## Setup

### Requirements
- Required
  - Python 3.5+
  - PyTorch (tested with version 1.4.0)
  - transformers (+sentencepiece, e.g. with 'pip install transformers[sentencepiece]', tested with version 4.1.1)
  - scikit-learn (tested with version 0.24.0)
  - tqdm (tested with version 4.55.1)
  - numpy (tested with version 1.17.4)
- Optional
  - jinja2 (tested with version 2.10.3) - if installed, used to export relation extraction examples
  - tensorboardX (tested with version 1.6) - if installed, used to save training process to tensorboard
  - spacy (tested with version 3.0.1) - if installed, used to tokenize sentences for prediction


## Examples
(1) Train Biocreative on train dataset, evaluate on dev dataset:
```
python ./spert.py train --config configs/example_train.conf
```

(2) Evaluate the CoNLL04 model on test dataset:
```
python ./spert.py eval --config configs/example_eval.conf
```
